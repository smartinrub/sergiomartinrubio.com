[Spring Cloud Config Server](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/){:target="_blank"} provides remote configuration for your Spring applications or any application running in any language. This tool has been out there for a long time, so it is very mature and reliable. _Spring Cloud Config Server_ comes in handy when you need to set up configurations for microservices in multiple environments, so you can manage properties separately and avoid the hassle of triggering application builds when only the configuration is updated.

## Getting Started

By default _Spring Cloud Config Server_ uses git to store the configuration files, however you could write your own implementation and use a different version control system (_VCS_). 

Clients retrieve the configuration through _Spring Cloud Config Server_ and both client and server have to be mapped to the Spring `Environment`, which contains:

- `{application}` is `spring.application.name` on the client side.

- `{profile}` is `spring.profiles.active` on the client.

- `{label}` is the commit id, branch name, or tag.

Property files can be named and located as follows:

```shell
 /{application}/{profile}[/{label}]
 /{application}-{profile}.yml
 /{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml
 /{application}-{profile}.properties
 /{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties
```

>Note: Active profiles take precedence over defaults. When multiple profiles are selected, the last one will be chosen.

>Note: If the git branch or tag name contains slashes (`/`) they must be replaced with underscores (`_`).

### Client Side

The following Maven dependency is required on the config server clients:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

then you only need to set a few Spring properties in `bootstrap.yml`:

```yml
spring:
  application:
    name: first-client
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
  profiles: 
    active: development
```

where the `spring.application.name` will be mapped to the `{application}` part of the property file stored in git; `spring.cloud.config.uri` is the `Spring Config Server` application address; and `spring.profiles.active` will be mapped to the `{profile}` part of the property file. Additionally, you could set `spring.cloud.config.label` which would be mapped to the commit id, branch name, or tag. For the previous example you should have a property file named `first-client-development.yml` on your git config repo in order to use the remote configuration.

>Note: Remember that `bootstrap.yml` is loaded before `application.yml`, and so the first one is needed if your application's configuration is stored on a remote configuration server and properties need to be decrypted.

### Server Side

The _Maven_ dependency required on the server side is:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

By simply using the `@EnableConfigServer` annotation, _Spring Cloud Cloud_ is configured in the _Spring Boot_ application.

```java
@EnableConfigServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class ConfigServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConfigServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

also a couple of properties have to be set on the application property file:

```yml
server:
  port: 8888
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/smartinrub/spring-cloud-bus-config-server.git 
```

where `server.port` is used to run the application in a particular port; and `spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri` is the git repository URL where the property files are stored.

>Note: You could create a git repository on your local machine, commit the changes and set `spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri` to something like `file://${user.home}/config-repo`, so you can test your configuration locally.

### Encrypted Properties

_Spring Cloud Config Server_ supports property encryption. You can use either symmetric or asymmetric key encryption. Spring recommends to use a symmetric key since you will only need to configure a single value in the bootstrap property file, however you might want to use asymmetric keys if you want to increase the security.

You can encrypt and decrypt properties with `/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints, or use the [Spring CLI tool](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-cli.html){:target="_blank"} with the [Spring Cloud plugin](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-cli){:target="_blank"}.

For instance, you can encrypt a property like this:

```shell
curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d mysecret
```

and to decrypt it like this:

```shell
curl localhost:8888/decrypt -d 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
```

>Note: Encrypted vales require the prefix `{cipher}` when you put them in `application.properties` (or `.yml`).

#### Symmetric

```yml
encrypt:
  key: ${ENCRYPT_KEY} ## any string
```

To configure a symmetric key, you need to set `encrypt.key` to a plain text string in Spring _Cloud Config Server_ (the client does not require this key since values are decrypted automatically before they are sent to the client) and set the `ENCRYPT_KEY` environment variable to keep it out of plain-text repository files. For example, you can pass it using Jenkins while running your pipeline.

>Important: [Automatic decryption is not working for 2.2.0.M3](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/issues/1493) when headers contain `application/vnd.spring-cloud.config-server.v2+json`, since `includeOrigin` is set to true. This is happening because the property source now contains a  `PropertyValueDescriptor` instead of a string value, so `toString()` method returns the object address. In the meantime you are force to decrypt the values in the client by setting the `encrypt.key` property.

>Note: `ENCRYPT_KEY` overrides `encrypt.key` value.

You can also disable decryption of properties before sending them to the client. To do this you have to set `spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled` to `false` (`true` is the default value). When this property is set to `false`, `encrypt.key` is required in the client for decryption during start up.

#### Asymmetric

The symmetric key is superior in terms of security, but it is usually less convenient since you have to set a few properties.

A keystore is needed to set up an asymmetric key. This requires a password which itself would have to be stored unencrypted and then set the keystore password as an environment variable.

```shell
keytool -genkeypair -alias myKeyStore -keyalg RSA \
  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" \
  -keystore server.jks -storepass password123
```

Finally, set the keystore configuration in the _Spring Cloud Config Server_:

```yml
encrypt:
  key-store:
    location: classpath:keys/server.jks
    password: ${ENCRYPT_KEY}
    alias: myKeyStore
```

>Note: If a property cannot be decrypted the value will be replaced with `<n/a>`.

### Dynamic Configuration Changes

Another important feature of _Spring Cloud Config Server_ is the possibility of refreshing the client configuration at runtime without restarting the _JVM_. By default, configuration values are read on the clientâ€™s startup. To take advantage of this feature you need to enable the `/refresh` endpoint. To do so, go to your client application properties file and include the endpoint:

```yml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: refresh
```

>Note: `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency is required in order to activate management endpoints.

Once the endpoint is enabled on the client you can hit the `/refresh` endpoint:

```shell
curl -X POST localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
```

>Note: **What's happening under the hood?** The `ContextRefresher` class is called, then it iterates through all the property sources and searches for changes, publishes an event to signal a change in the environment and finally it destroys the current instance of all beans in this scope and forces a refresh on next method execution.

As you can see this is a very nice feature, however it is not very convenient out-of-the-box, because once you start having many services running refreshing on each one will become a hassle, that is why _Spring_ provides a practical way to trigger the refresh event for all related services when property change, and this can be achieved with [Spring Cloud Bus](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-bus/reference/html/){:target="_blank"}. **How does it work?** When the refresh event of one of the services is triggered, this event is automatically broadcasted through all the other services by using a message broker, and this can be translated as a distributed **Actuator**.

{% include elements/figure.html image="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/miHCBc1VpFzGFG3SW3mqLSVFE8iGHew2vGhpDdi8gxB8jglRk2qe5G9LBUXwdopQfMPseQV_2nXZMbUbJcLUNelLUm5k5Vk66faEUUfDXTSKurO2bLBdak3JHGWxUmMO__ZyYOchWw=w1000" caption="Spring Cloud Config Server Diagram" %}

**Spring Cloud Bus** uses a message broker, and you can choose between [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com){:target="_blank"} or [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org){:target="_blank"}. In case of _RabbitQM_ you can [run it with Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/){:target="_blank"} as follows:

```shell
docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

and add the following dependency to all the client services:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

In order to enable `/actuator/bus-refresh` you have to add another exclusion in the services consuming the properties:

```yml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: refresh, bus-refresh
```

Now if you hit the endpoint `/actuator/bus-refresh` of one of your services:

```shell
curl -X POST localhost:{server-port}/actuator/bus-refresh
```

the selected service will publish a refresh event in the chosen message broker and will broadcast it across all the connected services.

The broker message configuration can be shared by creating a `application.yml` or `application.properties` to the root of your configuration repo and adding the connection properties to it.

>Note: Any property that is added in to the `application.properties` (or `.yml`) in the root of your configuration repository is shared among all services. This is very useful when you want to share common configuration (like database addresses) across applications.

#### What's next?

You can go a step further by automating the task of hitting the bus refresh endpoint. Many source code repositories like _GitHub_, _Gitlab_ or _Bitbucket_ notify you of changes in a repository through a [web-hook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/){:target="_blank"}. The [web-hook can be configured to listen changes in your config repo and broadcasting the refresh event for the all connected services through Spring Cloud Bus](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/multi/multi__push_notifications_and_spring_cloud_bus.html){:target="_blank"}.

A couple of dependencies in the _Spring Cloud Config_ server are needed to make this work:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-config-monitor</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

and set to true `spring.cloud.bus.enabled` property in `application.yml` (or `.properties`). Finally, you have to set up a web-hook on _Github_ as follows:

{% include elements/figure.html image="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rgL3p_tEbYVIs3mQVfr7dmV1BOyD8LOwYv_pizN-h1PgomG9ScA3lCMeQ4Yzs2cM-BY13JtLLcCkGaupX8UmO1sSzYTy5860ceETXYKSC8Kt9NCNyA_oBurqz0rUPpFa6CofSzh2Tw=w1000" caption="Spring Cloud Config Server GitHub Webhooks" %}

{% include elements/figure.html image="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P8iTW8qq9SlaiSI-uC2uzLCk-OSWH01lexYdPlvXmOZTbVRwmnFLFbwivH3npV5E0DDP2Kc9YaZABbbWyAxH8cSCxr4szTzgK1ciQeXvnm3neZelg4NPK_sDeZOiUDYoP-vThcbOHQ=w1000" caption="GitHub Web-hooks Deliveries" %}

To try this out you can either make the _Spring Cloud Config Server_ application public or you can simulate a git push notification request.

```shell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8888/monitor" 
-H 'X-GitHub-Event: push' 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-d '{
    "commits": [
        {
            "modified": [
                "application.yml"
            ]
        }
    ]
}'
```

>Note: To make your application public you could set up you router with a port forwarding rule.

The config server application will create a refresh event in the message broker and based on the application name used for the property file name, it will send the refresh event to the services that need to be refreshed.

### Other Features

- Set multiple repositories with `spring.cloud.config.server.git.repo`.
- Set the timeout for retrieving properties from git with `spring.cloud.config.server.git.timeout` (default value is 5 seconds).
- Force the pull from git if you set `spring.cloud.config.server.git.force-pull` to true.
