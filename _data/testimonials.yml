  review: It was an absolute pleasure to work with Sergio for the past year. Sergio is one of the best teammates that you can find, as he always find time to do what is necessary and do it right. Sergio always takes feedback on board as well and contributes to discussions constructively, which really helped us grow the engineering culture in our team. It's going to be difficult for us to find another Sergio!

  review: “Smiling learner” that’s what comes to my mind when I think about Sergio. Sergio reported to me during my time at Gamesys as a software engineer and he demonstrated to be a brilliant team player and a very capable engineer. He tackles the hardest problems and gives always 110%. I would recommend Sergio as an excellent software engineer to any company.
