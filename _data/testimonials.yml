  review: Working with Sergio in his capacity as a senior engineer has been an incredibly delightful experience. I can confidently affirm his exceptional technical knowledge and problem-solving capabilities. Sergio possesses extensive expertise in Java and microservices architecture, and his knack for discovering innovative solutions to intricate issues has proven to be an invaluable asset to Bound. Sergio excels in leading collaborative projects with fellow team members and consistently delivers outcomes within designated timeframes. His remarkable talent lies in effectively conveying technical information and collaborating seamlessly with non-technical colleagues. Sergio led the development of a project that became one of Bound’s most profitable products, highlighting both his technical prowess and exceptional interpersonal abilities.

  review: “Smiling learner” that’s what comes to my mind when I think about Sergio. Sergio reported to me during my time at Gamesys as a software engineer and he demonstrated to be a brilliant team player and a very capable engineer. He tackles the hardest problems and gives always 110%. I would recommend Sergio as an excellent software engineer to any company.
